This official repository contains the source code, prediction results, and evaluation toolbox of Deep Gradient Network (accepted by Machine Intelligence Research 2023), also called DGNet. The technical report could be found at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12853).


## 1. Features

<p align="center">
    <img src="assest/BubbleBarFig.png"/> <br />
    <em> 
    Figure 1: We present the scatter relationship between the performance weighted F-measure and parameters of all competitors on CAMO-Test. These scatters are in various colors for better visual recognition and are also corresponding to the histogram (Right).
    The larger size of the coloured scatter point, the heavier the model parameter. (Right) We also report the parallel histogram comparison of model's parameters, MACs, and performance.

- **Novel supervision.** We propose to excavate the texture information via learning the object level gradient rather than using boundary-supervised or uncertainty-aware modeling.

- **Simple but efficient.** We decouple all the heavy designs as much as we can, yielding a simple but efficient framework. We hope this framework could be served as a baseline learning paradigm for the COD field.

- **Best trade-off.** Our vision is to achieve new SOTA with the best performance-efficiency trade-off on existing cutting-edge COD benchmarks.

- [2022/11/18] The segmentation results on CHAMELEON dataset are availbale here: [DGNet (CAHMELEON)](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/u7248002_anu_edu_au/EXz2zGPFwWJLufVlnnNMjoABHd0bq3I-cwQgSTdQLbtaLQ?e=c1xsxB) and [DGNet-S (CHEMELEON)](https://anu365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/u7248002_anu_edu_au/EZYA_mIuor1FqA7y5cbrcjoB1nybWNq4mGnBkHADMAZLIQ?e=dEopfd).
- [2022/11/14] We convert the PyTorch model to [ONNX model](https://onnx.ai/) that is easier to access hardware optimizations and [Huawei-OM model](https://www.hiascend.com/software/mindx-sdk) that supports Huawei Ascend series AI processors. More details could be found at [lib_ascend](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/lib_ascend).
- [2022/11/03] We add the support for the [PVTv2](https://github.com/whai362/PVT) Transformer backbone, achieving excitied performance again on COD benchmarks. Please enjoy it -> ([link](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/lib_pytorch))
- [2022/08/06] Our paper has been accepted by [Machine Intelligence Research (MIR)](https://www.springer.com/journal/11633).
- [2022/05/30] :fire: We release the implementation of DGNet with different AI frameworks: [Pytorch-based](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/jittor_lib) and [Jittor-based](https://github.com/GewelsJI/DGNet/tree/main/jittor_lib).
- [2022/05/30] Thank @Katsuya Hyodo for adding our model into [PINTO](https://github.com/PINTO0309/PINTO_model_zoo/tree/main/299_DGNet). This is a repository for storing models that have been inter-converted between various frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX).

## 3. Proposed Framework

### 3.1. Overview

<p align="center">
    <img src="assest/DGNetFramework.png"/> <br />
    <em> 
    Figure 2: Overall pipeline of the proposed DGNet, It consists of two connected learning branches, i.e., context encoder and texture encoder. 
    Then, we introduce a gradient-induced transition (GIT) to collaboratively aggregate the feature that is derived from the above two encoders. Finally, a neighbor connected decoder (NCD [1]) is adopted to generate the prediction.

    It use a soft grouping strategy to provide parallel nonlinear projections at multiple fine-grained sub-spaces, which enables the network to probe multi-source representations jointly.
